            1) There can be a collision of random numbers making it less on the
            mine map.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            2) The oracle process time maybe slow causing it to delay or
            potentially return nothing.
          </li>
          <li>3) Possibly a UI error.</li>
          <li>4) Gas validation and id inaccuracy on UI.</li>
