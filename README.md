# Mine Sweeper

## An On Chain solidity implementation of MineSweeper game

### Mine Sweeper 
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them.     

Solidity Minesweeper is an onchain implementation of the Mine Sweeper game.     
How it is made:   
_ smart contracts _ 
- chainlink vrf is used to create an oracle to supply verified random numbers upon request.
- then the numbers are stored in an array and are fitted into 36 tiles with a total of 10 mines
- then we call a fucntion that takes in a tile id to move

* frontend *       
- this is just a representation of the smart contract (GUI)
